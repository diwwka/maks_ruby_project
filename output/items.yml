    the presidential election of 2016 comes Political Suicide, a history of the best
    and most interesting missteps, peccadilloes, bad calls, back room hijinks, sordid
    pasts, rotten breaks, and just plain dumb mistakes in the annals of American politics. They
    have tweeted their private parts to women they're trying to impress. They have
    gotten caught on tape doing and saying things they really shouldn't have. They
    have denied knowing about the underhanded doings of underlings — only to have
    a paper trail lead straight back to them. Nowadays, it seems like half of what
    we hear about politicians isn't about laws or governing, but is instead coverage
    focused on shenanigans, questionable morals, and scandals too numerous to count.
    And while we shake our heads in disbelief, we still can't resist poring over the
    details of these notorious incidents.In Political Suicide, the foibles of our
    politicians are brought from the tabloid pages to this entertaining — and cautionary
    — tale of American history. ...more
